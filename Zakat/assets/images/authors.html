                    <h3><b>The poperty which is imposed on Zakat</b></h3>
                    <p>Zakat, Arabic zakāt, an obligatory tax required of Muslims, one of the five Pillars of Islam. The zakat is levied on five categories of property—food grains; fruit; camels, cattle, sheep, and goats; gold and silver; and movable goods—and is payable each year after one year’s possession. The tax levy required by religious law varies with the category. Recipients of the zakat include the poor and needy, the collectors themselves,.</p>

                    <h3>Social Impact of Zakat</h3>
                    <p>Zakat is a popular Islamic weapon in shaping the welfare of society which has moral, social, and economic values.
Economically, zakat balances social life by distributing wealth from rich people to poor societies.
However, the greatness that is aimed to be realized was not sufficient in encouraging people to implement zakat itself, even for its value owners which is Moslem’s community. This is why the target of obtaining zakat in each region as well as national does not always achieved.</p>

                    <h3>PERSON WHO CAN NOT TAKEN ZAKAT</h3>
                    <p>Zakat is to be given to those who don’t have anyone legally responsible for taking care of them. In Islam, it is the husband’s responsibility to take care of his wife, pay for the bills, put food on the table. Therefore he should not be giving her Zakat since it is his duty to maintain her minimal financial well-being anyway. </p>
